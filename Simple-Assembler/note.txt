ERRors:
1) Typo
if inst[0] not in op_code or inst[1] not in reg:
    print("typo_error in inst")
    break;

2)undefined variables
traverse through whole and convert each character 
to ascii value and check for b/w ((48 to 57) or (65 to 90) or (97 to 122) or 95)

3)undefined lables
traverse through whole and convert each character 
to ascii value and check for b/w ((48 to 57) or (65 to 90) or (97 to 122) or 95)


4)Illegal use of FLAGS register
For mov and load instruction
if inst[1] == FLAGS:
    print(Illegal use of FLAGS register)

5)Illegal Immediate values 
if inst[2][1:]>255 or <0:
    print(Illegal Immediate values )
    break;

6)Misuse of labels as variables or vice-versa
when we encounter label 
if label is in variables:
    print(error)

when we encounter variables 
if variables is in labels:
    print


7)Missing hlt instruction
if "hlt" not in inst_list:
    print(Missing hlt instruction)
    break;

8)hlt not being used as the last instruction

9)Wrong syntax used for instructions (For example, add instruction being used as a
type B instruction )
"add" "R1" "R2" "R3"
"add" "R1" "$4"
